## Astro Base

Astro Base is a minimalist starter for web projects built with Astro, designed
to provide a solid and lightweight foundation. It includes an initial setup with
Tailwind CSS, SEO support, integration with modern tools like Vitest and
Playwright, and best practices such as linting, code formatting, and
preconfigured Git hooks.
